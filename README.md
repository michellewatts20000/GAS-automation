# Google App Script Automation

TLDR: Automation using Google Sheets and Google App Script.

Automating email sends from Google sheets.

What you need to do first:
- Need to create a google sheet.
- Need to update row[] numbers to match your google sheet
- Edit title of sheet, in example they are 'Active' and 'Completed'

The spreadsheet is interactive in 3 ways:
1) sends email if cell is left blank for 4 days
2) sends email to email address specified in another cell if a column is edited
3) when you check a box an email is sent to to email address specified in another cell that row is then cut from the sheet and added to another sheet
